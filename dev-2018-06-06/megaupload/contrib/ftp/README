To make use of FTP support replace the 'standard' upload2.php file with
the one in this folder. Don't forget to copy the ftp.php file into the
same folder as well.

You will have to open upload2.php in your favourite editor and change
the settings for server, username and password.

Before you attempt to use FTP upload please make sure that your 
standard installation is installed correctly and also try connecting to
your FTP server with the chosen username, password combination.

If you run into errors you might want to enable logging in the FTP class
by changing the $enable_log variable to 1 ($enable_log=1)
