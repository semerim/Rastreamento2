MEGAUPLOAD
----------

As with many open source projects the documentation hasn't kept pace
with the development. You will find that the docs on the projects' 
website at http://www.raditha.com/megaupload/ will be usually more 
upto date than what is included in the download.

You are encouraged to read through the message board if you find any
trouble installing or configuring megaupload. Chances are you will find
that someone else has already encountered the same problem and posted 
a fix.

If you are having trouble with large file uploads you might find the 
following article useful: http://www.radinks.com/upload/config.php

If you are having trouble with your sessions you might find the post at
https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=994196&forum_id=300744
interesting.

You will also find that the contrib folder contains a variation that 
passes cookie data between the perl and php scripts.

And don't forget to look at the webserver error log file before you post
your question.

Finally something that I should have said long ago:
The author of megaupload assumes that you are familiar with the PHP 
language and it's configuration settings. Please refer to the manual
at http://www.php.net/
