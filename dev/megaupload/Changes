0.90 Initial release

0.91 Additional documentation added.

1.00 The use of cookies to share information betweem the 'posting acceptor' and the progress bar
	 was dropped. This makes mega upload accessible even by those users who dislike cookies.
     Though the limit on file uploads was imposed on the demo, that was a feature that didn't somehow
	 make it's way into the release. Now it's included. Settings are changed in header.cgi

1.01 The progress bar has been made smoother with the help of a 'sleep'. If you are already successfully
	using megaupload on your site you might not want to upgrade since it does not introduce any 
	new features or fix any bugs

1.02 Added a cached control header and removed the 'non-blocking' nature of stdin based
	on user feedback.

1.03 added a minor improvment to get rid of the 'annoying clicking sound' seen on ie.

1.10 The progress bar now displays time elapsed, time remaining and upload speed (kb/s)

1.20 A much improved progress monitor.

1.30 FTP upload

1.40 No more POST

1.42 Fixed a bug in 1.41 and reorganized how temporary files are used.
