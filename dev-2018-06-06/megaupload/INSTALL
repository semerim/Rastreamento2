How to install Mega Upload.
===========================

Requirements.
-------------
1) A webserver.
		apache recommended

2) perl installed.
	LWP, CGI and Fcntl modules are required for versions prior to 1.40
    CGI, Fcntl and File modules for versions 1.40 or higher
		
	(These are available by default on most webservers running on linux 
	based systems.)

3) PHP 4


Installation Steps.
-------------------
1) copy the files in the php folder to your webspace. This will be
	/var/www/html or /usr/local/apache/htdocs for default installations
	of apache. c:\inetpub\wwwroot for IIS

2) copy the files in the cgi-bin folder into your webservers cgi-bin 
	directory. For 'standard' apache installations this may be
	/var/www/cgi-bin or /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin

3) load upload.html in your browser and test. 

4) If your web server's cgi-bin is NOT labeled as cgi-bin you will have
	to edit the upload.php and replace '/cgi-bin/upload.cgi' with what
	ever your path is. Also open header.cgi and change the line that 
	starts with php_uploader to match your PHP scripts url.

That's all folks.
